User Stories (2 Points)

This is a simple app to bring restaurants, coffee shops(products) and patrons together in a forum type application. 
The end goal is for users(patrons) to make a better decision on which product to choose based on their friends "word to mouth" approach.


1. There will be two users on this app.
	a. The product (rest or coffeeshop) will be the topic.
	b. The patron will be able to type "words" in a specific topic.
2. Users can geolocate their position (dont know how this will work exactly).
3. Users can login with their Facebook account.
