User Stories (2 Points)

This is a simple app to bring restaurants, coffee shops(products) and patrons together in a forum type application. 
The end goal is for users(patrons) to make a better decision on which product to choose based on their friends "word to mouth" approach.


1. **There will be two users on this app.**
	* The product (rest or coffeeshop) will be the topic.
	* The patron will be able to type "words" in a specific topic.
2. **Users can geolocate their position (dont know how this will work exactly).**
3. **Users can login with their Facebook account.**
